# scrimp
scrimp has two things:
1. A bunch of bytecode tests to help you see what is the most bytecode efficient route to go down
2. A collection of lightweight data structures and algorithms in java for use in MIT's BattleCode competition (battlecode.org)
    * Note that these won't be the fastest, but they will be much better than using the built in java.utils.* data structures

## ByteCode Tests

Check out [the tests](docs/bytecode/bytecode.md)!

## Data structures

#### Who should use this
These aren't the best things to use, they are just a lot faster than the Java equivalents. For example:
